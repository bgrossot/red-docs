== Concept 

In order to support writing debuggers, profilers, analyzers and other useful tools that are needed for efficient programming, the interpreter is offering a generic event-oriented low-level API on top of which all these tools can be written. It is similar to the `parse/trace` and `lexer/trace` instrumentation approach.

== Interpreter instrumentation

In order to access internal interpreter states, the interpreter is generating events at key points of his internal code evaluation process. Those events can be captured using a user-provided callback function. Events are emitted only if a _tracing_ mode is enabled in the interpreter using `/trace` refinement on `do`.

----
do/trace <code> <callback>

<code>     : a block of code to evaluate in tracing mode.
<callback> : a callback function, triggered on each interpreter event.

== Events

[cols="1,1,1,1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Event   | Code     | Value   | Ref     | Description
|*`ENTER`* | `block!` | `unset` | `none` | when a block is about to be evaluated.
|*`EXIT`*  | `block!` | `unset` | `none` | when current evaluated block's end has been reached.
|*`OPEN`*  | `block!` | `any-function!` | `word!` or `path!` | when a new function (any-function!) call is pushed on stack and a new stack frame is opened.
|*`RETURN`*| `block!` | returned value | `word!` or `path!` | when a function call has returned and its stack frame has been closed.
|*`PROLOG`*| `none`   | -       | -       | when entering a function.
|*`EPILOG`*| -        | -       | -       | when exiting a function.
|*`FETCH`* | -        | -       | -       | a value is read from the input block to be evaluated.
|*`PUSH`*  | -        | -       | -       | a value has been pushed on the stack.
|*`SET`*   | -        | -       | -       | a set-word is set to a value.
|*`CALL`*  | -        | -       | -       | a function with all arguments fetched on the stack gets called.
|*`ERROR`* | -        | -       | -       | when an error occurs and is about to be thrown up in the stack.
|*`THROW`* | -        | -       | -       | when a value is thrown using `throw` native.
|*`CATCH`* | -        | -       | -       | when a value is caught using `catch` native.

== Predefined tools

=== `debug`

Debugger commands:

* `next` or `n` or just ENTER: evaluate next value.
* `continue` or `c`: exit debugging console and continue evaluation.
* `stack` or `s`: display the current calls and expression stack.
* `parents` or `p`: display the parents call stack.
* `:word`: outputs the value of `word`. If it is a `function!`, dump the local context.
* `:a/b/c`: outputs the value of `a/b/c` path.
* `watch <word1> <word2>...`: watch one or more words. `w` can be used as shortcut for `watch`.
* `-watch <word1> <word2>...`: stop watching one or more words. `-w` can be used as shortcut for `-watch`.
* `+stack`  or `+s`: outputs expression stack on each new event.
* `-stack`  or `-s`: do not output expression stack on each new event.
* `+locals` or `+l`: output local context for each entry in the callstack.
* `-locals` or `-l`: do not output local context for each entry in the callstack.
* `+indent` or `+i`: indent the output of the expression stack.
* `-indent` or `-i`: do not indent the output of the expression stack.
